  <h2>Welcome to Yo Brewski!</h2>  
  <p>Taste our best types of beer brewed from carefully selected barley, wheat and hops.</p>
  <p>Quality British malted grains, hops for flavour and bitterness, fresh wet yeast (not dried, taste the difference) and local Speyside water. All our beers are natural and unfined meaning they are suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Unlike many other commercial breweries, our precise brewing process ensures that we can produce flavoursome clear beer, without the need to use isinglass, a clearing additive derived from the swim bladders of fish.</p>
